I focus on multi-modal representation learning. Most of my recent works are related to few-/zero-shot adaptation of vision-language models for novel tasks and data, including image segmentation and video recognition. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student member of [Algorithmic Intelligence Laboratory @ the KAIST AI](http://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/index.html), advised by Dr. Jinwoo Shin. Previously, I graduated from Hanyang University with M.S. and B.S degrees under Dr. Jun-Won Choi, where I studied machine learning models for motion forecasting and autonomous driving.
