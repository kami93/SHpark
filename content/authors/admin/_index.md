I focus on multimodal representation learning. In particular, much interest of mine is now on capturing complementary interactions between texts and vision and a model's sense of uncertainty under quantitative and qualitative variations in the multimodal information. I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree at [Algorithmic Intelligence Laboratory @ the KAIST AI](http://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/index.html), advised by Dr. Jinwoo Shin (My official terms of study start from September 2021). Previously, I graduated from Hanyang University with M.S. and B.S degrees under Dr. Jun-Won Choi, where I studied machine learning models for motion forecasting. Please find my CV for more details!
